        Safen User Input Part I - htmlspecialchars<br>
        You are a(n) novice/average/experienced/professional/world-famous Web Developer (choose one) who owns <br>
        a(n) simple/clean/slick/beautiful/complicated/professional/business website (choose one or more) which <br>
        contains form fields so visitors can send emails or leave a comment on your website with ease. However, <br>
        with ease comes danger. Every now and then, a hacker visits your website and attempts to compromise it <br>
        through the use of XSS (Cross Site Scripting). This is done by injecting script tags into the website <br>
        through form fields which may contain malicious code (e.g. a redirection to a malicious website that <br>
        steals personal information).<br>
<br>
        Mission<br>
        Your mission is to implement a function that converts the following potentially harmful characters:<br>
<br>
        < --> &lt;<br>
        > --> &gt;<br>
        " --> &quot;<br>
        & --> &amp;<br>
        Good luck :D<br>
    </p>
